A sample Python project
=======================

PyFit is a [Cython](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library
of exercise physiology and healthcare equations for transforming basic health
data into insights at scale.  PyFit compiles bodybuilding competition formulas,
aerobic performance models, and body composition equations with a holistic
approach to health, giving developers back their time and the freedom to develop
the application they envision.
