# PyFit

PyFit is a [Cython](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library of exercise physiology and healthcare equations for transforming basic health data into insights at scale.  PyFit compiles bodybuilding competition formulas, aerobic performance models, and body composition equations with a holistic approach to health, giving developers back their time and the freedom to develop the application they envision.
